# Minecraft Fabric DirtCheap Mod

Dirt must be dirt cheap. But in Minecraft cobblestone is cheaper than dirt, because it is free.

Although there are complicated ways to create dirt from cobblestone, I do not like them. 
So I made this mod to make dirt really cheap by adding a few recipes that allow duplication
of dirt blocks by mixing them with cheap, easily renewable items.
